Code for CSCI1020 TermProject


myLCS_DP finds the longest common subsequence of two DNA sequences using dynamic programming. The user can either specify two explicit strings, a value n such that randomly generate strings (DNA sequence, so only ACGT letters) of length n are used, or by default use random strings of length 12

myLCS_Re finds the longest common subsequence of two DNA sequences using recursive methods. The user can either specify two explicit strings, a value n such that randomly generate strings (DNA sequence, so only ACGT letters) of length n are used, or by default use random strings of length 12
